Password Strength Checker

Alright, so we've got some Python code here that's all about checking the strength of passwords. It's got a nice graphical interface thanks to Tkinter, which is a library for making GUIs in Python.

First up, the code imports a couple of things. `string` is a module that helps with working with strings, like finding out if a character is a letter or a number. And then there's `tkinter`, which we're calling `tk` for short, that's what we'll use to make our GUI.

The `check_pwd()` function is where the magic happens. When you hit the "Check Password" button, it goes through the password you typed in and checks how strong it is. It looks at things like if it has uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, spaces, or special characters. Then, based on what it finds, it gives you some feedback on how strong or weak your password is.

The GUI part is pretty straightforward. We've got labels for showing "Password:", the results of the password check, and some feedback on the strength of the password. And of course, there's an entry field where you can type your password. Oh, and don't forget the button that you click to check your password.

There's also a little checkbox that lets you toggle between seeing your password in plain text or as asterisks. It's a nice touch for when you want to make sure you typed your password correctly.

And lastly, we've got the mainloop. That's what keeps everything running smoothly, listening out for any clicks or other actions from you, the user.

Overall, it's a handy little tool for making sure your passwords are up to scratch, all wrapped up in a friendly GUI.
